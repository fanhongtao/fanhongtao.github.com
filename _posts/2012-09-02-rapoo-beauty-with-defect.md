Last week, I ordered a Rapoo 9020 wireless optical combo from [Amazon](http://z.cn), and received express delivery on Monday.

I choose it beacuse of:

* its NANO reciver, as it said, plug-and-forget;
* its small keyboard size, so that I can put it in the bag with notebook;
* and of course its price, it's cheap, only RMB 135, about 20 dollars.

At first, I used it on a notebook with 32bit-Win 7, it works perfect. Just plugin and play.

But when I tried to use it in on another notebook with 64bit-Win 7, it could not be recognized by Windows. Beacuse the 64bit notebook is my target, I have to find ways to use it. I found that if I delete the device from Windows and restart Windows, I could use devices for a few minute, at that time, Windows recognized it as an unkonwn device, after that, when Windows recognized it as a <i>Rapoo 2.4G wireless device</i>, I cound not use it anymore.

I tried to download driver from www.rapoo.com, but could not find it. Tried to let window not to find driver for it, but failed to do that. ...

After too many failed test, and I just re-install the Windows, for the last try. And fortunately, it works. I don't know why. Maybe it's a bug of rapoo'a driver?
